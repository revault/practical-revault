# Messages

A description of how information is exchanged between the different entities, as well as the
flow of operations.

These messages are exchanged on top of an [encrypted and authenticated communication
channel](network.md).

JSON is used (pretty similarly to JSONRPC2) in order to prime debuggability over efficiency for
the v0 specifications.  
Parsing should not be strict (ie unknown entries in a mapping should be disregarded) for forward
compatibility.

- [Cosigning server](#cosigning-server)
- [Coordinator](#coordinator)

## Watchtower

At least one watchtower is ran by every stakeholder, and at most one wallet is paired with
each watchtower. A watchtower needs to be able to see all fully-signed revocation transaction
before its corresponding wallet signs the unvaulting transaction.

In addition, a watchtower will by default revault any unvaulting attempt. We need a way
for the watchtowers to poll the spending transaction (as its revaulting policy may depend
on it). For this matter we use the coordinator as a proxy between the managers
and the watchtowers.
When noticing an unvaulting attempt, the watchtower will poll the coordinator
for a potential spend transaction. If there is one and it is valid according to its
revaulting policy, it will not do anything. Otherwise it will broadcast the cancel
transaction.


### Rough flow

```
 STAKEHOLDER's WALLET                      WATCHTOWER
    ||   -- sigs -------------->     ||  // Here are all sigs for the emergency transaction.
    ||  <-------- sigs_ack -----     ||  // I succesfully re-constructed, checked, and stored this transaction.
```

### Messages format

#### `sigs`

Sent at any point in time by a stakeholder's wallet to share the revocation transactions' signature
with (one of) its watchtower(s).

It must wait for a positive response from the watchtower before sharing the Unvault transaction
signature.

The Cancel transaction signature is shared at various feerates. This is for the watchtowers to be
able to adapt the Cancel transaction to the fee market, short of having a decent fee-bumping
technique.  

#### Request

```json
{
    "method": "sigs",
    "params": {
        "signatures": {
          "emergency": {
              "pubkeyA": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
              "pubkeyB": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
          },
          "cancel": {
              "feerate A (sat/vb)": {
                  "pubkeyA": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
                  "pubkeyC": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
              },
              "feerate D (sat/vb)": {
                  "pubkeyB": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
              }
          }
          "unvault_emergency": {
              "pubkeyA": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
              "pubkeyB": "SIGHASH_ALL Bitcoin ECDSA signature as hex",
          }
        },
        "deposit_outpoint": "deposit utxo outpoint",
        "derivation_index": 42
    }
}
```

#### Response

The watchtower must not send an ACK if it did not successfully checked and stored all transactions'
signatures, *or if it is unable to bump its feerate with its currently-available utxos*.

```json
{
    "result": {
        "ack": true,
    }
}
```

## Cosigning server

A cosigning server is ran by each stakeholder. It is happy to sign any transaction input
it can, but only once.

### Rough flow

```
  WALLET                      COSIG_SERVER
    ||   -A-- sign  -------->    ||   // A: I need you to sign this transaction input
    ||   <-- sign result ----    ||   // Server: *signs* .. Here you go.
    ||
    ||   -B-- sign  -------->    ||   // B: I need you to sign this same transaction input
    ||   <-- sign result ----    ||   // Server: I already signed an input spending this outpoint, here is the existing signature
```

### Messages format

#### `sign`

Sent at any point in time by a manager who'll soon attempt to unvault and spend one or
more vault(s).

As the spend transaction must only spend unvault transaction outputs, the cosigning server
shall sign all inputs (if all of them were not already signed).


#### Request

```json
{
    "method": "sign",
    "params": {
        "tx": "psbt"
    }
}
```

#### Response

The server must:
  - if no prevout was already signed
    - return the PSBT with its (newly generated) signature appended to each input
  - if all prevouts were already signed
    - return the PSBT with its (previously generated) signature appended to each input
  - else
    - return `null`

```json
{
    "result": {
        "tx": "psbt"
    }
}
```
Or
```json
{
    "result": {
        "tx": null
    }
}
```

## Coordinator

The coordinator is a proxy for watchtowers to retrieve spend transactions, and conveniently
permits to share pre-signed transaction signatures without interaction between participants.

As each wallet will verify and store signatures locally, the server isn't trusted and can be
managed by the organisation deploying Revault itself or any third party without risking any
loss of funds.

The server will also broadcast the spend transactions when the unvault timelock is expired; this
way managers could shut down their wallets after broadcasting the unvault without further delaying
the spend broadcast.

Acting as a cache in place of -example given- a p2p network, the information stored on the
coordinator is transient.


### Rough flow

```
 STAKEHOLDER's WALLET          COORDINATOR
    ||   -A-- sig   -------->    ||   // A: Here is a sig for this txid !
    ||   -C-- sig   -------->    ||
    ||   -B-- sig   -------->    ||
    ||
    ||   -C-- get_sigs  ---->    ||   // C: I gave my sig but now am waiting for everyone to complete..
            ...(polling)
    ||   -A-- get_sigs  ---->    ||
            ...(polling)
    ||   -B-- get_sigs  ---->    ||
            ...(polling)
            ...(polling)              // Eventually they all retrieve the sigs.
```

```

 MANAGER's WALLET                COORDINATOR
    ||   -- set_spend_tx  ------->   ||  // I'm going to unvault these vaults, here is the
                                            fully signed spend transaction so watchtowers
                                            don't freak out.
```

```
  WATCHTOWER                      COORDINATOR
    ||   -- get_spend_tx  ------->   ||  // Is there any available spend tx for this vault ?
    ||  <--- spend_tx   ----------   ||  // Here is what i know about. I may be lying but worst case you revault.
```


### Messages format

#### `sig`

Sent by a stakeholder wallet at any point in time to share the signature for a transaction
with all other stakeholders and all managers.  
Note that the managers are able to poll the Emergency transactions signatures from the
coordinator. However, since they are not able to reconstruct the transactions (they don't
know the `scriptPubKey`) they can't use them to DOS the operations by broadcasting them
to the Bitcoin network.

The wallet can safely post its signature for the `cancel` and `emergency`s of each
`vault` without waiting for others. However, it must wait for everyone to have signed
the `cancel` and `emergency` transactions and its watchtower to have verified and stored
the signature before possibly sharing its signature for the unvault transaction.

A wallet is not bound to share its signature for the unvault transaction. This flexibility
allows "inactive vaults": a multisig which is not spendable by default but still guarded
by the emergency transaction deterrent.  
A wallet must share its signature for the `cancel` and the unvault `emergency`
transactions nonetheless.  
An inactive vault may later become active by sharing signatures for the `unvault`
transaction.  

Revocation transactions (`cancel` and `emergency`s) are signed with `SIGHASH_ALL`.


#### Request

```json
{
    "method": "sig",
    "params": {
        "pubkey": "Secp256k1 public key used to sign the transaction (hex)",
        "signature": "Bitcoin ECDSA signature (without sighash type byte) as hex",
        "txid": "transaction txid"
    }
}
```

#### Response

The Coordinator must only set `ack` to `true` if it claims to have successfully stored the signature.

```json
{
    "result": {
        "ack": true
    }
}
```


#### `get_sigs`

Sent by a wallet to retrieve all signatures for a specific transaction.


#### Request

```json
{
    "method": "get_sigs",
    "params": {
        "txid": "transaction txid"
    }
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
    "result": {
        "signatures": {
            "pubkeyA": "Bitcoin ECDSA signature",
            "pubkeyC": "Bitcoin ECDSA signature"
        }
    }
}
```

Note the absence of `pubkeyB` in the above samples.


#### `set_spend_tx`

Sent by a manager to advertise the Spend transaction that will eventually be used for a
set of Unvault.


#### Request

```json
{
    "method": "set_spend_tx",
    "params": {
        "deposit_outpoints": ["txid:vout", "txid:vout"],
        "spend_tx": "base64 of Bitcoin-serialized fully-signed spend transaction"
    }
}
```

#### Response

The Coordinator must only set `ack` to `true` if it claims to have successfully stored the Spend
transaction.

```json
{
    "result": {
        "ack": true
    }
}
```


#### `get_spend_tx`

Sent by a watchtower to the coordinator after an unvault event to learn
about the spend transaction.
The coordinator might not have the spend transaction, in which case it will
return `null`.


#### Request

```json
{
    "method": "get_spend_tx",
    "params": {
        "deposit_outpoint": "txid:vout"
    }
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
    "result": {
        "spend_tx": "base64 of Bitcoin-serialized spend tx"
    }
}
```
or, if the coordinator doesn't have the spend:
```json
{
    "result": {
        "spend_tx": null,
    }
}
```
